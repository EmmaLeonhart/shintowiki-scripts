# shintowiki-scripts — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** When an item is done, delete it. Finished work lives in `git log` and `DEVLOG.md`. It fills up and you barrel through it during a session; clearing the queue = doing the items, not relocating them. Standing policy/notes do NOT live here — they go in `CLAUDE.md`.

Bulk LLM-grunge work (duplicated_content reorg, need_translation translation, fandom template fixup) lives in `remote_queue.json` and is worked by the claude.ai remote routine — not duplicated here.

Pinned tail (keep last, always):
- [ ] Ensure the three autonomous-loop crons (work-loop :03, auto-flush :15, status-report :42) are running; start them if this session hasn't.
- [ ] Run the status-report action once more independently as an end-of-session summary.
