# shintowiki-scripts — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** When an item is done, delete it. Finished work lives in `git log` and `DEVLOG.md`. It fills up and you barrel through it during a session; clearing the queue = doing the items, not relocating them. Standing policy/notes do NOT live here — they go in `CLAUDE.md`.

Bulk LLM-grunge work (duplicated_content reorg, need_translation translation, fandom template fixup) lives in `remote_queue.json` and is worked by the claude.ai remote routine — not duplicated here.

_The English-label-first translation agenda (metabolized 2026-06-21) is complete: the 4-stage English-label pipeline (Stage 3 dropped per Emma), both downstream generators repointed to English, zh script variants, the per-language coverage registry (`shinto-label-generator/language_registry.py`, 44/116 covered), Vietnamese/Bengali/Greek/Hebrew + European/Latin affix batches, and the CJK→ja backfill all shipped. See `docs/english_label_pipeline.md` and `docs/language_coverage.md`. The remaining long-tail languages (Thai/Burmese/Georgian script maps, single-digit-label langs) were deliberately not hand-built — they failed the verification gate or are too low-value — and are left for the LLM/manual per Emma's scope decision._

Pinned tail (keep last, always):
- [ ] Ensure the three autonomous-loop crons (work-loop :03, auto-flush :15, status-report :42) are running; start them if this session hasn't.
- [ ] Run the status-report action once more independently as an end-of-session summary.
